# Vulkan Setup for Windows Using CMake and Visual Studio Code

There are various vulkan resources and tutorial that shows how to setup vulkan but I could not find any that set it up from scratch using VSCode and CMake on Windows.

The goal of here is to setup base vulkan setup on WINDOWS using `CMake` on VSCode. The only Vulkan tutorial I found that shows how to setup Vulkan with CMake was from "Brendan Galea" on of his vulkan tutorials videos series. [Project Restructure and CMake - Vulkan Game Engine Tutorial 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuHK_5cJ6B8&list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR&index=31). This happened later on after the series has gone far.  But I was able to use this to come up with this basic setup.
